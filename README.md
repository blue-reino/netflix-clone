# Basic Netflix Clone

A very simple Netflix Clone. It's not exactly a 1:1 clone, but I tried to recreate the frontend as best as I could. 
This project was not made for production, but for me to learn some frontend and basic backend web development.

# How to test

Simply run npm start in the source folder, after installing React 


## Technologies Used

* React

* Bootstarp: For some basic styling

* Remix Icon: for some design icons

* Amazon AWS Cloud Storage: For the billboard images

* Vidsrc API (https://vidsrc.to/): for the movies
