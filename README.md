# Basic Netflix Clone

A very simple Netflix Clone. It's not exactly a 1:1 clone, but I tried to recreate the frontend as best as I could. 
This project was not made for production, but for me to learn some frontend and basic backend web development.

# How to test

Simply run npm start in the source folder, after installing React 


# Technologies Used

* React

* Bootstarp: For some basic styling

* Remix Icon: for some design icons

* Amazon AWS Cloud Storage: For the billboard images

* Vidsrc API (https://vidsrc.to/): for the movies
  

# Development Process and Challenges

* I started off with a basic general layout of the top half of the Netflix homepage.
  ** This included the navbar and the hero section. The hero section is where a featured movie is displayed, as well as a small trailer. At this beggining point, this only consisted of an image, with some text for the movie name and description.
* Next I began working on the movie slider. This is basically where you can choose a movie to watch from each "topics." For example, "New Releases" and "Trending Now." At first these were all placed in the Home.js page, but then I moved these over to a custom component, this made it cleaner and a lot more efficient.
